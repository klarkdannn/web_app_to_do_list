Where are the most beautiful places in the world? On a planet home to flamingo-pink lakes in Mexico, plus vast, multi-coloured hills
in the USA, green ripples of rice paddies in Indonesia and epic icescapes in Antarctica, it's hard to choose a favourite – but why
pick one? From countries all around the world, these are our top 60 most beautiful places to visit.

    Outer Hebrides, Scotland

    Scattered along Scotland's west coast, this chain of isles is one of the country's most beautiful places to visit. Think
    shimmering white-sand beaches, sparkling seas and crowd-free hinterlands – it's one of the UK's last remaining secrets, and for
    good reason.

    Douro Valley, Portugal

    With endless rows of vines tumbling down hillsides and birds of prey swooping along the riverside, at first glance you'd think
    this place was anywhere but Europe. Right in the depths of Portugal, this valley is as romantic as it comes – hike along ridges,
    taste-test your way through the region's wine and cosy up in some of the country's very best hotels, before waking up and doing
    it all again.

    Shark Bay, Australia

    The most westerly point on mainland Australia is this UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was founded before Captain Cook discovered
    land at Botany Bay, with Dutch explorers touching down here in the 17th century. The area is diverse – there’s a beach made up
    entirely of tiny white shells, stromatolites on the shore of Hamelin Pool and the salt mine at Useless Loop, which produces the
    purest grade of salt in the world and is only accessible via four-by-four – or visible from the sky.

    A small seaside town in the Ica region of Peru, Paracas is where the desert meets the sea. A trip to the area isn’t complete
    without a boat ride to Islas Ballestas, the rocky islands off the Pacific coast known for their diverse wildlife including flocks
    of sea lions and crowds of baby penguins.

    Algarve, Portugal

    The red-cliff coastline and pristine whitewashed Moorish villages that dot the south-western region of Portugal have started
    shifting crowds away from the region’s busier hotspots. It has its own sunny microclimate and affordable places to stay such as
    Casa Mãe in Lagos make it a great winter-sun option too.

    up of mounds of undulating bone-white, wave-like volcanic rock and forms one of the island’s most mesmerising bays.

    Death Valley, California

    Known as the hottest place on earth, Death Valley reached a record temperature of 53°C in 2019. It’s a vast area of extremes:
    with snowy peaks, scorching sands and wildflower meadows, the National Park encompasses a wide range of different landscapes. One
    of the most popular locations is the multi-hued Artists Palette, a series of eroded hills whose colouring is due to the oxidation
    of natural metal deposits in the mountains. ‘Star Wars’ fans will be keen to see the site that inspired the planet Tatooine.

    Bayon, Cambodia

    Built in honour of one of Cambodia’s most famous kings, Jayavarman VII, Bayon is a 12th-century state temple that’s a unique
    architectural feat in the heart of Angkor Thom. Fifty-four gothic towers carved with 216 gargantuan smiling faces of
    Avalokiteshvara – the bodhisattva of compassion – fill the temple, and the design showcases the shift from Hinduism to Mahayana
    Buddhism. With Angkor Wat not far away, Bayon, its off-the-beaten track little sister, is a close second in popularity.

    The famous three peaks of the National Park are among Wyoming’s most recognisable sights, the Grand forming the highest point of
    the range. It’s a hike on many pro adventurers' list, but for newbies looking for an outdoors excursion floating down the Snake
    River or mountain-biking through the 310,000-acre landscape are viable options, too. Top it off with supper at Snake River Grill

    through the Atacama Desert into the Peruvian Amazon and up to Venezuela. Vast expanses of sandy flats quickly roll into high tops
    of dunes and gorges leading to plateaus of dusty grass. It’s a trip for explorers, with the Andes standing tall above the
    Argentine–Chile border, blurring one side into the other. NASA even uses the desert as a testing ground for future Mars missions.

    best ways to view the still-active volcano is by taking the shinkansen bullet train from the capital to Osaka (top tip: sit on

    18th-century royal-owned Rajmahal Palace is a smart hotel. Among the famously rosy-hued buildings of the Pink City, the
    honeycomb-like Hawa Mahal, or Palace of the Winds, is surely the most recognisable of all. The incredible sandstone structure has
    953 small exterior windows (called jharokhas) decorated with intricate lattice work.

    Redwood National Park, California

    Home to the world’s tallest trees, Redwood National Park, north of San Francisco, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and part of an
    International Biosphere Reserve that protects close to half of the planet’s old-growth redwoods – some of which are 370ft high.
    With more than 200 miles of trail routes, it’s ideal for camping, hiking and riding.

    Havana, Cuba

    The crumbling façades of this island nation's capital keep bringing in waves of travelling artists, rum fanatics and cigar
    smokers to the city. It’s where Hemingway wrote seven of his books and drank Mojitos at La Bodeguita del Medio. And with
    temperatures of 27°C in December, it’s an ideal winter-sun destination.

    Kyoto, Japan

    Considered to be the cultural centre of Japan, Kyoto is awash with ancient temples and shrines, serene teahouses and sublime
    gardens. The bright-orange Fushimi-inari, a shinto shrine in the hills, is a visual beauty. Grab an artisan coffee, taken very
    seriously in the traditional city, and make the two-hour pilgrimage through the shrine's thousands of torii (gates). Other spots
    worth visiting include Gion, the home of the geishas, the golden pavilion of Kinkaku-ji and Nishiki market for street food or a
    traditional kaiseki feast at one of the city's local restaurants.

    The kaleidoscopic city may best be known for its market life, spice sellers and ancient medinas, but its reimagined riads, cool
    independent shops and contemporary art scene are giving it a modern edge. There are lots of places to discover – from Yves Saint
    Laurent’s restoration of cobalt-blue Jardin Majorelle to the smoky street-food stalls in Jemaa el-Fna.

    Bondi Icebergs might easily be the most famous pool in the world. The Olympic-size structure has been standing on the southern
    end of Bondi Beach for more than 100 years. It’s not heated or chlorinated, but filled with seawater, with the Tasman Sea
    crashing against its edge.

    Arashiyama, Bamboo Forest, Japan

    About 20 minutes outside Kyoto’s city centre is the atmospheric Arashiyama bamboo forest. Arrive at around 7am to avoid the
    crowds and get a chance to see and feel the wood, as well as hear it creaking in the wind. Morning light is just as ethereal,
    too. Arabica coffee shop is nearby, overlooking Hozugawa River.

    The incredible pink lakes here make up part of the protected nature reserve of Ría Lagartos Biosphere on Mexico’s Yucatán
    peninsula. Red-coloured algae, plankton and brine shrimp that thrive in the waters not only turn the native flamingos pink but
    help produce 500,000 tons of salt per year.

    Avenue of the Baobabs, Madagascar

    This is one of Madagascar's most visited natural sites – and for good reason. Aside from the spectacular photo opportunities on
    offer as the sun casts auburn shades on the trees, travellers come to support local conservation efforts, and spot the unique
    wildlife that frolics in the overgrowth nearby.

    Blue lagoon, Iceland

    One of Iceland's most spectacular sites is, surprisingly, man-made. The Blue Lagoon's waters are a byproduct of a nearby
    geothermal power plant, which passes through turbines and into the lagoon. Natural geological layers account for the water's rich
    mineral content, which travellers use to their benefit, bathing and smothering themselves in the rich clay.

    Eager to spot a waddle of penguins in the wild? There's no need to save up for the ultimate excursion to Antarctica – although
    that's just as high on many bucket lists. On the shores of some of South Africa's most picturesque beaches, the animals mingle in
    search of a mate – safe from the fearsome great white that circle beneath the waves just metres away.

    The Grand Canyon, USA

    The Grand Canyon is part of the Colorado River basin and, aside from its beauty, is geologically significant as the waters that
    pass through here have revealed billions of years worth of rock layers. While it's popular with travelling day-trippers, native
    Americans still call it home, having first settled in the caves thousands of years ago.

    Cenotes, Mexico

    Formed by the collapse of eroded limestone, Mexico's cenotes harbour secrets and beauty discovered by sunshine-chasers each year.
    The unique formations were celebrated by the ancient Maya people, and archaeological investigations over the years have found
    artefacts made from gold, jadeite, shell and more on the sandy depths.

    Stone tools and spearheads discovered in Joshua Tree National Park suggest the region was inhabited as long as 8,000 years ago.
    Modern travellers experience this wilderness in a very different way, checking into luxurious micro-resorts and serviced holiday
    homes. Think the landscapes are otherworldly by day? Look to the skies at night for an altogether different, and unforgettable,
    sight.

    The Maldives

    Spoiling retreats of all shapes and sizes litter the sandy banks of the Maldives, an archipelagic state in the Indian Ocean.
    Between the indulgent wellness resorts and exotic restaurants, the crystal-clear waters offer ample opportunity for snorkelling
    and diving excursions. Dive into the blue and find yourself in a world of kaleidoscopic colour as fish fizzle in and out of
    focus.

    The third most populated island in the Seychelles, La Digue takes its name from a ship in the fleet of French explorer
    Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne, who visited the Seychelles in 1768. Thanks to its otherworldly granite formations, glassy waters
    and fine sand, Anse Source d'Argent is often regarded as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world – a spot travellers fawn
    over as they venture out from the island's uber-luxurious hotels and resorts.

    Yellowstone National Park, USA

    Bison, bears, geese, deer – these are just some of the animals that call the oldest national park in the world home. Each change
    of the seasons beckons new residents out of their homes, as many cosy up during the cold winters and await the first signs of
    spring. A highlight of the park is the Yellowstone Caldera, a gargantuan crater that was formed by a cataclysmic volcanic
    eruption some 640,000 years ago.
